Questions and requested information:
Observer Screen:
  1. Notes: 
       Need examples of pre-defined set of pull-downs. We could allow for both pull-downs 
       and type-in text.
       
  2. Location and Behavior 
       Need examples 
       
  3. In-Range - clarification to determine in-range. Possibilities - 1. observer would not
     be allowed to select patient if not within range. 2. system could log the -out of 
     range - condition (tag malfunction) 3. Combine with 'Proximity Indicator' turn 
     progress bar to 'red' for within range.
     
  4. Low Battery - could have progress bar. When observer is 'rounding' a patient, screen
     would indicate battery level - green, yellow and red for various levels.]
     
  5. Discharge - does the observer to the discharge?   
      
       
       
       
       
TODO:
Add progress bar in stead of signal strength. More negative - further away. Need 
 calibration. smoothing algorithm 
 
 Need ability to remove patient from device on the fly( moved to different unit).
